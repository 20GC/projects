SERVERSIDE- GET SERVER RUNNING
1. Authentication
	-Create username (that's not taken) and password.
	-Use username as player token in database
2. User tracking
	-Wins/losses, amount of games, maybe moves made all saved to part of player token (username)
3. Multiplayer/Networking
4. Player Interaction
(don't know enough for detail yet)



CHESS GAME- NEEDS PLAYER INTERACTION (MAY BE TIC TAC TOE, WHICH IS DONE)
Data:
-GameOver variable [global] (can be tied to checkMate?)
-Locations of pieces [local, movement] (hash function or double array, name to tile?)
-Turns [global] (per move, change 1 to 0 or 0 to 1)
-Black/White piece difference [local, movement] (name scheme with 'w' or 'b' as beginning, or 0-15 white and 16-31 black?)
-Pieces no longer in play / pieces in play [local, movement] (set tile to -1, if tile not -1, in play?)
-Check or Not Check [global]
-What a click does [global?] (click to select a piece, or click to select where to move?)
-What each piece does [global?] (method of movement connected to name scheme?)

Architecture:
-Title screen
-Find a friend screen?
-Change screen when game made and connected
-Click input, multiple clicks per turn
-Screen change output to move pieces or take pieces
-Game over screen

User Interface:
Very simplistic chess. Solid color, light grass green background, basic "Chess" or "Garrett Chase's Chess"
title, "New Game" button, maybe "Options" button for background color or something?
Board is simple grid, light brown and dark brown tiles with an in-between color trim. Pieces are custom
paint images or free-use 2D chess piece images. 

Procedural:
-On load, load buttons, background color, title name.
-On button press, either load into game or load "Here's a code for your friend, or enter a code" screen to connect.
-Load game by loading board lines and colors, track if each tile is clicked (or background), load pieces in position.
-Do not allow a player to select while not their turn.
-White's turn, first click on a tile with a piece selects, click on background deselects, click on 
	empty space OR enemy space within movement moves piece, then black's turn.
-Pieces who were moved to by enemy should be put on side or disappear, unable to be selected.
-Check forces only king to be selected, or selection of pieces who's movement kills or blocks piece.
-Checkmate when king cannot move or kill and when no other piece can block or kill
-Game Over screen if checkmate, 'Exit' button back to title or 'Play Again' button with same function as New Game button
